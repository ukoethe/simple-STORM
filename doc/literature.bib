@article{pmid19493110,
	abstract = {Common methods for quantification of colocalization in fluorescence microscopy typically require cross-talk free images or images where cross-talk has been eliminated by image processing, as they are based on intensity thresholding. Quantification of colocalization includes not only calculating a global measure of the degree of colocalization within an image, but also a classification of each image pixel as showing colocalized signals or not. In this paper, we present a novel, automated method for quantification of colocalization and classification of image pixels. The method, referred to as SpecDec, is based on an algorithm for spectral decomposition of multispectral data borrowed from the field of remote sensing. Pixels are classified based on hue rather than intensity. The hue distribution is presented as a histogram created by a series of steps that compensate for the quantization noise always present in digital image data, and classification rules are thereafter based on the shape of the angle histogram. Detection of colocalized signals is thus only dependent on the hue, making it possible to classify also low-intensity objects, and decoupling image segmentation from detection of colocalization. Cross-talk will show up as shifts of the peaks of the histogram, and thus a shift of the classification rules, making the method essentially insensitive to cross-talk. The method can also be used to quantify and compensate for cross-talk, independent of the microscope hardware.},

	abstract = {Colocalization of differently labeled biomolecules is a valuable tool in fluorescence microscopy and can provide information on biomolecular interactions. With the advent of super-resolution microscopy, colocalization analysis is getting closer to molecular resolution, bridging the gap to other technologies such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Among these novel microscopic techniques, single-molecule localization-based super-resolution methods offer the advantage of providing single-molecule coordinates that, rather than intensity information, can be used for colocalization analysis. This requires adapting the existing mathematical algorithms for localization microscopy data. Here, we introduce an algorithm for coordinate-based colocalization analysis which is suited for single-molecule super-resolution data. In addition, we present an experimental configuration for simultaneous dual-color imaging together with a robust approach to correct for optical aberrations with an accuracy of a few nanometers. We demonstrate the potential of our approach for cellular structures and for two proteins binding actin filaments.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate that commercially available unmodified carbocyanine dyes such as Cy5 (usually excited at 633 nm) can be used as efficient reversible single-molecule optical switch, whose fluorescent state after apparent photobleaching can be restored at room temperature upon irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Ensemble photobleaching and recovery experiments of Cy5 in aqueous solution irradiating first at 633 nm, then at 337, 488, or 532 nm, demonstrate that restoration of absorption and fluorescence strongly depends on efficient oxygen removal and the addition of the triplet quencher beta-mercaptoethylamine. Single-molecule fluorescence experiments show that individual immobilized Cy5 molecules can be switched optically in milliseconds by applying alternating excitation at 633 and 488 nm between a fluorescent and nonfluorescent state up to 100 times with a reliability of \&gt;90\% at room temperature. Because of their intriguing performance, carbocyanine dyes volunteer as a simple alternative for ultrahigh-density optical data storage. Measurements on single donor/acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine/Cy5) labeled oligonucleotides point out that the described light-driven switching behavior imposes fundamental limitations on the use of carbocyanine dyes as energy transfer acceptors for the study of biological processes.},

Numerous sparse subsets of photoactivatable fluorescent protein molecules were activated, localized (to approximately 2 to 25 nanometers), and then bleached. The aggregate position information from all subsets was then assembled into a superresolution image. We used this method--termed photoactivated localization microscopy--to image specific target proteins in thin sections of lysosomes and mitochondria; in fixed whole cells, we imaged vinculin at focal adhesions, actin within a lamellipodium, and the distribution of the retroviral protein Gag at the plasma membrane.},

	abstract = {P>In the recent past, single-molecule based localization or photoswitching microscopy methods such as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) or photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) have been successfully implemented for subdiffraction-resolution fluorescence imaging. However, the computational effort needed to localize numerous fluorophores is tremendous, causing long data processing times and thereby limiting the applicability of the technique. Here we present a new computational scheme for data processing consisting of noise reduction, detection of likely fluorophore positions, high-precision fluorophore localization and subsequent visualization of found fluorophore positions in a super-resolution image. We present and benchmark different algorithms for noise reduction and demonstrate the use of non-maximum suppression to quickly find likely fluorophore positions in high depth and very noisy images. The algorithm is evaluated and compared in terms of speed, accuracy and robustness by means of simulated data. On real biological samples, we find that real-time data processing is possible and that super-resolution imaging with organic fluorophores of cellular structures with similar to 20 nm optical resolution can be completed in less than 10 s.},

	abstract = {The minimum covariance determinant (MCD) method of Rousseeuw is a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter. Its objective is to find h observations (out of n) whose covariance matrix has the lowest determinant. Until now, applications of the MCD were hampered by the computation time of existing algorithms, which were limited to a few hundred objects in a few dimensions. We discuss two important applications of larger size, one about a production process at Philips with n = 677 objects and p = 9 variables, and a dataset from astronomy with n = 137,256 objects and p = 27 variables. To deal with such problems we have developed a new algorithm for the MCD, called FAST-MCD. The basic ideas are an inequality involving order statistics and determinants, and techniques which we call "selective iteration" and "nested extensions." For small datasets, FAST-MCD typically finds the exact MCD, whereas for larger datasets it gives more accurate results than existing algorithms and is faster by orders of magnitude. Moreover, FAST-MCD is able to detect an exact fit-that is, a hyperplane containing h or more observations. The new algorithm makes the MCD method available as a routine tool for analyzing multivariate data. We also propose the distance-distance plot (D-D plot), which displays MCD-based robust distances versus Mahalanobis distances, and illustrate it with some examples.},

	abstract = {In super-resolution microscopy methods based on single-molecule switching, the rate of accumulating single-molecule activation events often limits the time resolution. Here we developed a sparse-signal recovery technique using compressed sensing to analyze images with highly overlapping fluorescent spots. This method allows an activated fluorophore density an order of magnitude higher than what conventional single-molecule fitting methods can handle. Using this method, we demonstrated imaging microtubule dynamics in living cells with a time resolution of 3 s.},
