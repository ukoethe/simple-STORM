SELF-CALIBRATING ANALYSIS OF STORM DATA
=======================================

dSTORM microscopy can improve the resolution of conventional fluorescent
microscopy by one order of magnitude. The data analysis software has to
localize many thousand single molecule point-spread-functions to
reconstruct an image of the underlying structure.

Content of this archive:
  storm/  sources for single-molecule-localization
          and command-line utility to analyze .sif and .hdf5 input data
  gui/    Qt-based graphical-user-interface (GUI) for selection of
          input files and appropriate parameter(s)
  python/ helper scripts to analyze and display the coordinate
          lists generated by the utilities above
  colorcomposer/
          multi-channel measurements have to be aligned due to
		  chromatic aberrations. Tetraspeck-Beads are detected
		  automatically so that the images can be registrated easily.

A manual is in doc/doc.pdf.

See INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install storm or storm-gui from scratch.
